#Water Pump Removal Instructions

Before you begin, unplug your washing machine from the wall. Turn off and disconnect the water supply to the machine. These precautions will help to prevent accidental electric shock and water leakage. With another person, move the washing machine to a well-lit space with plenty of room to work.

Place the washing machine on its front face to expose the back plate. Remove all screws from the back plate and store them in a safe place. 

The clips at the bottom of the washer are delicate and may snap if you're not careful. Unfasten them and store them in the same place as the screws. You'll need them all to reattach the back plate after you install your new water pump. This helps to prevent the back plate from loosening and screws from breaking when you run the machine. 

With the clips unfastened and screws removed, lift off the back plate and place it to the side. Inside the machine, you'll notice two hoses connected to the water pump with a metal clamp (pictured below).

Use a pair of pliers to squeeze the clamp and pull it away from the fitting. The water hose is flexible and should come off with little effort. Repeat this process for the second hose. 

Two spring clamps on the under side of the water pump hold it in place. Use your pliers to remove the first clamp in the front. The image below shows the location of the first clamp.

Repeat this process for the second clamp. It may be difficult to see, you will need to remove it by feel. After you have removed both clamps, lift up the pump and pull it free of the motor.
